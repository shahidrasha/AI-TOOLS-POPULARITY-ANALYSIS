Dataset Creation

Designed a structured dataset tracking 150+ popular AI tools across 4 categories:

Conversational AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)

Generative AI (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)

Developer Tools (GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, Codeium)

Productivity Boosters (Notion AI, Grammarly, Quillbot)

Collected 200+ crowd-sourced votes ranking tools by usage frequency

2️⃣ Excel Data Preparation

Cleaned and standardized tool names/categories

Removed incomplete/invalid entries

Calculated popularity scores (votes weighted by user ratings)

Added conditional formatting to highlight top performers

3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development
Created an interactive report featuring:

Tool Popularity Leaderboard (Ranked 1-15)

Category Performance Comparison

Usage Trends by User Segment

Geographical Adoption Heatmap
In this project, I created an end-to-end analysis of AI tool popularity by building a custom dataset, cleaning it in Excel, and visualizing insights in Power BI.
